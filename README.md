### Travel Dashboard

Travel enthusiasts want to be able to track the countries they have visited and where they want to travel to in the future. Use an existing API, or create a new one, to display information about countries, travel plans, and other relevant information.

## MVP
* Display countries for users to select from
* Allow users to add countries to a "countries I have been to" list
* Allow users to add countries to a "countries I would like to visit" list

## Possible extensions
* Display both lists on a map
* Display currency and languages for a selected country
* Allow users to create a schedule for an upcoming trip
